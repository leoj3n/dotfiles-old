# Astronomical UI theme

Astronomical UI theme for Atom.

Based on Atom's default light-theme, but with many UI modifications:

- Square tabs
- Find/Pallete animations
- Close icon animations
- GitHub-inspired Settings page
- Sidebar subfolder highlighting on hover
- Sidebar doesn't change colors on inactivity
- Textboxes without borders
- And more!

This can be activated by going to
the _Themes_ section in the Settings view (`cmd-,`) and selecting it from the
_UI Themes_ drop-down menu.
